# CoreMotionAlamoFire

This simple app uses CoreMotion to fetch pedometer data from the user and it uses Alamofire to fetch JSON data from a sample JSON file I created.

The JSON file contains a list of countries and their associated step data. Once a selection is made, the app displays the selected country's average step data and compares it to the user's step data.
